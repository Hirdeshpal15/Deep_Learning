# Deep Learning Projects
 
This repository contains a collection of hands-on deep learning projects and experiments created as part of my learning journey and practical applications.


## 🚀 Objective

To explore, implement, and evaluate various deep learning models using real-world datasets, covering key concepts such as CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, Transfer Learning, and Autoencoders.  
This repository is tailored to demonstrate my proficiency in deep learning to potential employers and collaborators in the AI/ML field.
